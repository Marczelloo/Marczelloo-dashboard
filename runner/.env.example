# Runner Configuration

# Port to listen on (default: 8787)
RUNNER_PORT=8787

# Shared secret token for authentication (required)
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
RUNNER_TOKEN=your-secret-token-here

# ========================================
# SSH Configuration (for Docker deployment)
# ========================================
# When running in Docker, the runner uses SSH to execute commands on the host
# This allows terminal access to the Pi from the dashboard

# Enable SSH execution (default: true)
SSH_ENABLED=true

# SSH host to connect to (default: host.docker.internal which resolves to Docker host)
SSH_HOST=host.docker.internal

# SSH user on the host
SSH_USER=pi

# Path to SSH private key inside the container (mounted from host)
SSH_KEY_PATH=/root/.ssh/id_rsa

# Default working directory for shell commands
DEFAULT_CWD=/home/pi

# ========================================
# Setup Instructions
# ========================================
# 1. Generate SSH key on your Pi (if you don't have one):
#    ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/dashboard_runner
#
# 2. Add public key to authorized_keys:
#    cat ~/.ssh/dashboard_runner.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#
# 3. Set SSH_KEY_PATH in your .env to point to the private key:
#    SSH_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/dashboard_runner
#
# 4. The docker-compose.yml will mount this key into the runner container
